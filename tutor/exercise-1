There are several ways to compress and decompress files on Linux
machines, depending on the algorithm for file compression.

- Zip is Windows native file compression format. It is available to
install on Linux machines as 'zip' and 'unzip' commands.

- The 'gzip' command uses the DEFLATE algorithm to compress files. To 
compress a file simply use 'gzip file'. To decompress a file you can
use either 'gzip -d file' or 'gunzip file'.  

- The 'zip2' command uses the Burrowsâ€“Wheeler block sorting algorithm.    
Again, to compress use 'bzip2 file' and to decompress a file you can
use either 'bunzip2 file'.  

Now determine the file type of 'badge-2'. Then open the file to receive
your second badge of the day.
