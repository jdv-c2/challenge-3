There are several ways to compress and decompress files on Linux
machines, depending on the chosen algorithm for file compression.

- Zip is Windows native file compression format, but is available for
install on Linux machines as zip and unzip commands.

- The gzip command uses the DEFLATE algorithm to compress files. To 
compress a file simply use 'gzip file'. To decompress a file you can
use either 'gzip -d file' or 'gunzip file'.  

- The bzip2 command uses the Burrowsâ€“Wheeler block sorting algorithm.    
Again, to compress use 'bzip2 file' and to decompress a file you can
use either 'bunzip2 file'.  

Determine the file type of 'badge-2', then open the file to receive
