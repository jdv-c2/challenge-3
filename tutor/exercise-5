We now know the file type of badge-4. We also know that we cannot 
view this file on a server machine, without a windowing system.

Therefore, we'll need to transfer the badge to our desktop 
workstation first. In order to do so, we can use the remote copy tool
'scp'. This command uses the ssh protocol to transfer files.

If you know how to use ssh, you will find transfering files very easy.
The command works like this:

'scp user@ip-address:/file-path .' 

(The dot specifies your current location). 

Now transfer the file 'badge-4' to your desktop environment.
