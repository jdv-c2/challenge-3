Today's ReadMe file is actually a link to another location.  

In Linux there are two methods of creating links or shortcuts:
- Hard links are a direct reference to a file via its index node or
  node. Hard links only work on files that are on the same partition;  
- Symbolic or soft links on the other hand, is a special filetype 
  that points to the original file or folder, much the same as a    
  shortcut in Windows.

Now go ahead. Find the real location of this ReadMe file by listing
the contents of my home folder in long format.
