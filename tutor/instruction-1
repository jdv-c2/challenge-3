Today's ReadMe file is actually a link to another location.  

In Linux there are two methods of creating links or shortcuts.

1. Hard links are a direct reference to the same file via its inode 
   (index node). Hard links only work on files that are on the same 
   partition. To create a hard link to a file use the command: 
   'ln file link_name'  

2. Symbolic or soft links on the other hand, are a special filetype 
   that holds a reference to the original file or folder, the same as 
   a shortcut in Windows. To create a symbolic link use the same 'ln'
   command, but with the '-s' option:
   'ln -s file link_name'

Now go ahead. Find the real location of this ReadMe file by listing
the contents of my home folder in long format.
