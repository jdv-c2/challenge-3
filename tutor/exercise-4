.--'--'-.    

Unlike Windows, file types are not determined by a file extension. 
Instead, Linux operating systems (and the 'file' command) determine 
the file type based on its file signature or its "magic bytes".  
These magic bytes are typically the first couple of bytes in a file.

You can find a list of magic bytes here: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures  

In order to identify the magic bytes of a file we can use the 
command: 'hexdump -C file'. This gives an output of the file in 
hexadecimal format.  

Retrieve the magic bytes of badge-4 with the 'hexdump -C' command.
Give the first six bytes of the file in hexadecimal notation.

Tip: pipe the output of the 'hexdump -C' command to the 'head' command. 

The file 'badge-4' cannot be viewed on a server without a windowing
system.  Go to ~/files/exercise-5 to find out how you can transfer this 
file to your desktop workstation.
